Eight years ago, I thought every problem could be solved with a good spreadsheet. Today, those spreadsheets have evolved into multi-cloud pipelines that save companies millions.

My path wasn't linear. Sales, customer success, market research, then Berlin's fintech scene. Each stop revealed the same painful gap: businesses drowning in data but starving for understanding.

That gap became my obsession.

I'm still the guy who starts complex projects with pen and paper, sketching logic before building systems. My GitHub reflects this journey—bridging business needs with technical solutions, experimenting with orchestration tools, diving into GO and system design.

When I'm not building pipelines or reading enterprise architecture patterns (currently Martin Fowler's classic), I'm cycling around Berlin.
